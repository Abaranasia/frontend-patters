    <h1>Strategy Pattern</h1>
    <p> This patter give us the chance to have different behaviors in an object and also add new ones</p>
    <img src="Strategy.png" alt="Strategy UML schemma">
    <p>The Strategy Pattern is based on a Context class with a strategy attribute and an action method. With this, we can have several classes defined, each of them being a different strategy to be set on the Context class and having the same action method as the Context class but its how especific behavior.</p>
    <p>The aim of this pattern is to be able to assign one or other strategy to an object depending on a given factor.</p>
